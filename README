====== ABOUT ======

Android About is an Android utility app for developers & testers who juggle APK variations. It
quickly shows the version name, version code, and certificate hash / signature for installed APKs
and for the base system image.

The certificate hash is particularly useful when switching between debug and release versions of an
APK.

Android About runs on Phone/Tablet (including as a widget), Wear and TV.

Q. Why not use Android->Settings?
A. Android Settings isn't great for disambiguation of different certificate versions etc, and isn't
as quick.

====== SOURCE ======

This is an Android Studio project, it should open & build cleanly within Android Studio.

common/
    Shared library with most of the logic.

    Phone & Tablet UI
wear/
    Wear UI

Add aliases for well known certificate hashes into CertificateUtil.java.

Consider adding Detailer subclasses to provide more detail for APKs, for example to
convert version names and version codes into developer/tester friendly codenames.

====== BUILDING & INSTALLING ======

./gradlew assembleDebug

adb install -r mobile/build/outputs/apk/mobile-debug.apk   # phone/tablet/tv
